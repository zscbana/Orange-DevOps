# Web Server Comparison and Configuration Guide: Nginx vs. Apache

## Introduction

This document provides a comparative overview of Nginx and Apache, two of the most popular web servers, along with example configurations for each. Understanding the strengths and optimal use cases for these web servers will help you make an informed decision for your web infrastructure.

## Overview

### Nginx

**Nginx** is known for its high performance, stability, and low resource usage. It operates primarily as an HTTP server but also supports other protocols like HTTPS, SMTP, and POP3. Nginx is designed to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.

**Key Features:**
- Asynchronous, event-driven architecture
- Efficient handling of static content
- Reverse proxy and load balancing
- Easy configuration for high-performance setups

### Apache

**Apache HTTP Server** (commonly referred to as Apache) is a highly flexible and widely-used web server. It is known for its rich feature set, strong community support, and compatibility with various modules.

**Key Features:**
- Process-driven architecture
- Extensive module support for extended functionality
- .htaccess support for directory-level configuration
- Comprehensive configuration options

## Configuration Comparison

Below are example configurations for Nginx and Apache to illustrate how you can set up a basic web server environment with each.

### Nginx Configuration

**Basic Server Block:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    
    root /var/www/example;
    index index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    # Logging
    access_log /var/log/nginx/example_access.log;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/example_error.log;
}

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
    ServerName example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example

    <Directory /var/www/example>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    # Logging
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
