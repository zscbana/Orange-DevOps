## Project Overview

In this project, we will create Deployments for each tier with 2 replicas for each:

- **Proxy**
- **Backend**
- **Database**

### Requirements

- All resources should be organized in a namespace called **`webapp`**.
- Mount **db-credentials** in pods from your host machine.
- Choose a suitable service for grouping each tier.
- Ensure that the proxy pods communicate with the service selected for the backend pods.
